# Insights_Summer_Project


This project is a transformative enhancement of a classic website, originally built with simple HTML, JavaScript, and CSS in the 1990s. Our goal is to breathe new life into this vintage gem by leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as React, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js. This modern makeover will elevate the user experience, bringing a sleek, aesthetic UI and rich features to a workshop website, blending nostalgia with innovation for a seamless and delightful user journey.
