Now we're taking 0 as the quotient and -3 as the remainder.\r\n          What is the advantage?. In many cases, it will be better if the absoloute value of the remainder is minimum.\r\n          So we take -3 as the remainder, rather than taking 4 as the remainder.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>Also, we said that, with Mishrank, we need not go back and make a correction. \r\n          Then why did we go back in the last step? In the last step, we've to find the final remainder. \r\n          The final remainder obtained can't be negative. \r\n          Hence we've to go back to obtain a positive final remainder.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <button style={{'margin-left':'40%'}}onClick ={()=>navigate(-1)}>BACK TO WHERE YOU LEFT</button>\r\n        <br/>\r\n        <hr/>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default There_a_way_out\r\n\r\nconst title={\r\n  marginLeft:'40%'\r\n}\r\n"],"mappings":";;AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,eAAe;AACtB,SAASC,WAAW,QAAQ,kBAAkB;AAC9C,OAAOC,UAAU,MAAM,0BAA0B;AACjD,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAK,6CAA6C;AAC/D,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAK,yCAAyC;AAC3D,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAK,yCAAyC;AAC3D,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAK,yCAAyC;AAC3D,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAK,yCAAyC;AAC3D,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAK,uCAAuC;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAEzD,MAAMC,eAAe,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EAAAC,EAAA;EAC5B,MAAMC,QAAQ,GAACZ,WAAW,CAAC,CAAC;EAC5B,oBACES,OAAA;IAAAI,QAAA,gBACIJ,OAAA,CAACR,UAAU;MAAAa,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAC,CAAC,eACfR,OAAA;MAAKS,KAAK,EAAC,MAAM;MAAAL,QAAA,gBACjBJ,OAAA;QAAIU,KAAK,EAAEC,KAAM;QAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;MAAe;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACtCR,OAAA;QAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACHR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAI4G;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEnHR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAG8G;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACrHR,OAAA;QAAGS,KAAK,EAAC,aAAa;QAAAL,QAAA,eAACJ,OAAA;UAAKY,GAAG,EAAElB;QAAO;UAAAW,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAC;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC9CR,OAAA;QAAGS,KAAK,EAAC,eAAe;QAAAL,QAAA,GAAC,8CAA4C,eAAAJ,OAAA;UAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,qBAAiB;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC/FR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAAmG;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC1GR,OAAA;QAAGS,KAAK,EAAC,aAAa;QAAAL,QAAA,eAACJ,OAAA;UAAKY,GAAG,EAAEjB;QAAO;UAAAU,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAC;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC9CR,OAAA;QAAGS,KAAK,EAAC,aAAa;QAAAL,QAAA,eAACJ,OAAA;UAAKY,GAAG,EAAEhB;QAAO;UAAAS,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAC;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC9CR,OAAA;QAAGS,KAAK,EAAC,eAAe;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAAgB;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC7CR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAAiB;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACxBR,OAAA;QAAGS,KAAK,EAAC,aAAa;QAAAL,QAAA,eAACJ,OAAA;UAAKY,GAAG,EAAEf;QAAO;UAAAQ,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAC;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC9CR,OAAA;QAAGS,KAAK,EAAC,aAAa;QAAAL,QAAA,eAACJ,OAAA;UAAKY,GAAG,EAAEd;QAAO;UAAAO,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAC;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC9CR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAIH;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAA+L;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACtMR,OAAA;QAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLR,OAAA;QAAIS,KAAK,EAAC,cAAc;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAC;MAA8C;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5ER,OAAA;QAAGS,KAAK,EAAC,aAAa;QAAAL,QAAA,eAACJ,OAAA;UAAKY,GAAG,EAAEnB;QAAO;UAAAY,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAC;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC9CR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAKH;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;MAIH;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;QAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLR,OAAA;QAAQU,KAAK,EAAE;UAAC,aAAa,EAAC;QAAK,CAAE;QAAAG,OAAO,EAAGA,CAAA,KAAIV,QAAQ,CAAC,CAAC,CAAC,CAAE;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAC;MAAsB;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAQ,CAAC,eAChGR,OAAA;QAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLR,OAAA;QAAAK,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACF,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACH,CAAC;AAEV,CAAC;AAAAN,EAAA,CAtDKD,eAAe;EAAA,QACJV,WAAW;AAAA;AAAAuB,EAAA,GADtBb,eAAe;AAwDrB,eAAeA,eAAe;AAE9B,MAAMU,KAAK,GAAC;EACVI,UAAU,EAAC;AACb,CAAC;AAAA,IAAAD,EAAA;AAAAE,YAAA,CAAAF,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
